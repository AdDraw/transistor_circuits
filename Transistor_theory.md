- Mobility of holes i 2/3 times lower than electrons -> Beta of PMOS sometimes should be adjusted to get unskewed gates
  - PMOS of same W/L should be slower than NMOS


Truths*

Longer channel -> Less Current (lower I)

Longer channel -> slower speed(longer path for carriers to traverse)

Wider channel -> more current(Bigger I)


**Carriers:**

- "things" that carry charge
- transport charge in a transistor
- go through the channel
- 2 types:
  - electrons - carry negative charge
  - holes - carry positive charge

Channel

- formed when VG > VT (kinda) and carriers flow from source under the gate

Weak Inversion

- when space under the gate is partially filled with carriers but not fully
- substrate

Inversion:

- in case of the NMOS transistor where holes of the substrate are pushed deeper into the substrate under the force of the electric field applied from the gate and carriers from the source/drain flow under the gate
- inversion of polarity,
  - pre inversion - polarity is dominated by substrate's  majority charge(in case of doping it's either that there is more electrons or holes)
  - depletion - electric field pushes holes/electrons from under the gate deeper into the substrate
    - with rising Gate fied, more and more substrate "carriers" are pushed into the substrate
    - depletion - no carriers are present from the source but all charge has been pushed deeper into the substrate forming a depleted region
  - when nearing VT, more and more carriers from the source are attracted under the gate
    - at VT, cahnnel is created because polarity has been inverted, carriers fully cover the space under the gate
