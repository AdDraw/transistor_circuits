Lamba Rules:

- Define constraints for widths/etc in the mask rules
  - smallest distance possible to place is 1Lambda == half of the feature size
    - feature size is the smallest distance in the given technology process (180nm, feature size = 180nm, lambda = 90nm = 180/2)
- not used a lot in newest processes since it generalizes too much, micron rules used for newer process
  - only problem of micron rules is that they are not transferrable between processes(while lambda is up to some feature size)
- Smallest theorethical transistor in lambda rules would be 2 Lambda by 2 Lambda (not 1 lambda since it is not possible to achieve)
  - PMOS if we scale it to have the same B as NMOS would have W twice as large(4lambda, while NMOS has 2 Lambda), to produce "twice" as much current and to "match" NMOS current
